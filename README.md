### üöÄ The Challenge

The challenge was to create a QR code card component and make it look as close to the provided design as possible. This involved:
* Structuring the content with semantic HTML.
* Using CSS to style the layout, colors, and typography.
* Ensuring the component is centered on the page.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The following tools and technologies were used in the construction of this project:

* **HTML5:** For structure and content semantics.
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and design.
    * **CSS Custom Properties (Variables):** To keep a cleaner and more reusable code for colors and spacing.
    * **Grid Layout:** To efficiently center the main component on the screen.

### üìñ What I Learned

As a front-end beginner, this project was a great opportunity to practice and solidify important concepts:

* **Semantic HTML Structure:** I used the `<main>` tag for the main content, which helps with accessibility and organization.
* **Using CSS Variables (`:root`):** I learned to centralize all my colors, fonts, and spacing in one place. This makes code maintenance much easier.
* **Centering Elements:** I practiced using `display: grid` and `place-items: center` on the `body` to center the card in a simple and robust way.
* **Box Model and `box-sizing`:** I deepened my understanding of how `padding`, `margin`, and `border-box` work together to create precise layouts.
* **Basic Responsive Design:** I used `max-width` to ensure the card doesn't get too large on bigger screens, maintaining a pleasant look.
